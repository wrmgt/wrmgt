## Hi there 👋

My name is Steve, and I work in infosec interested in all things offensive security.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a few different tools and exercises focused around offensive security.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vulnerability Research, Malware Development, and maintaining general red teaming knowledge.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on interesting hacking related tools and scripts in Python, Go,and C/C++ languages.
- 💬 Ask me about Skydiving or Airplanes. I have jumped over 5,000 times and I'm a licensed Pilot.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I live on a little ranch in the middle of nowhere. I like chickens, and I'm a terrible gardener.
