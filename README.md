## Hi there ğŸ‘‹

My name is Steve, and I work in infosec interested in all things offensive security.

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a few different tools and exercises focused around offensive security.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, C/C++, and Go.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on interesting hacking related tools and scripts in the above languages.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about Skydiving or Airplanes. I have jumped over 5,000 times and I'm a licensed Pilot.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I live on a little ranch in the middle of nowhere. I like chickens, and I'm a terrible gardener.
